            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- <a href="#bottom">below bottom paragraph</a> -->
            <p>
                I have a strong background in Java programming, data structures and algorithms, Java Spring Boot, MySQL
                database, Java libraries like Java Swing and AWT, and REST APIs.
                <br>I am also proficient in solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and
                HackerRank.
                <br>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Physical Sciences with a CGPA of 8.2 from Delhi University, and I am
                currently pursuing a web development course at AccioJob, a company partnered with NSDC.
                <br>Additionally, I have worked on several projects that demonstrate my ability to build scalable and
                secure backend systems. Some of them are FlipCommerce and Vaccination Booking System.
                <br>In these projects, I implemented the concepts of Relational Mapping, Dependency Injection, and
                followed the MVC architecture.
                <br>I successfully integrated Swagger and email functionality into these projects and deployed the
                applications on GitHub for version control.
